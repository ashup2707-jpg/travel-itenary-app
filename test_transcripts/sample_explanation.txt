# Sample Test Transcript: Explanation Session

## Question 1
"Why did you pick Hawa Mahal?"

## Response
Hawa Mahal is one of Jaipur's most iconic landmarks, known as the "Palace of Winds." Built in 1799, it features 953 intricately carved windows designed to allow royal women to observe street life without being seen. It's a must-visit attraction that perfectly aligns with your interest in culture.

## Question 2
"Is this plan doable?"

## Response
Yes, this plan is doable. Each day has a comfortable pace with 2-3 activities, plenty of breaks, and reasonable travel times between locations. The total travel time per day is under 2 hours, which leaves ample time for exploring and rest. The evening blocks are intentionally light to match your relaxed pace preference.

## Grounded: ✅ Yes

## Question 3
"What if it rains?"

## Response
Jaipur has a semi-arid climate with most rainfall during the monsoon season (July-September). If you're visiting outside monsoon, rain is unlikely. However, if it does rain, I recommend:
1. Visit indoor attractions first (City Palace has covered areas)
2. Amber Fort has many indoor sections
3. Jaipur has excellent indoor restaurants for extended meals

I should note that I don't have real-time weather data, so please check the local forecast closer to your trip.
